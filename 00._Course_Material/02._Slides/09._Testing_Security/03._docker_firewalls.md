# Introduction: Firewalls

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 

Firewalls can be either on hardware or software level.

# Firewalls in Linux

*Try to run the two commands on your server*

## iptables

`iptables` is low-level and highly flexible, providing granular control over traffic.

```bash
$ sudo iptables -L
```

## ufw

`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a higher-level interface for `iptables`, designed to simplify firewall management.


```bash
$ sudo ufw status
```

**NEVER** enable ufw without enabling ssh. This will lock you out of the server the next time you try to access the server.

# iptables examples

**DO NOT** run these commands on your production server unless you intend to do so

Allow incoming HTTP traffic on port `80`:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

Block a specific IP address:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP
```

Allow SSH (port 22) from a specific IP address:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.101 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

Allowing ssh with `ufw`:

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
```

# Docker and firewalls

Docker circumvents the UFW firewall and alters iptables directly when you instruct it about ports

Mapping the ports with `-p 9200:9200` (or in docker-compose) maps the port to the host but also opens it to the world! (bug report from '19)

> "Publishing ports produce a firewall rule that binds a container port to a port on the Docker host, ensuring the ports are accessible to any client that can communicate with the host."

[Issue](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/690)

In general it should not be a problem because there is an additional firewall on the cloud provider level.

# Possible solution - Limiting the IP range that the service is accessible from

Define the IP range to control where the service is accessible.

**Internal service** (only accessible from the host):

```yaml
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
```

**Public service** (accessible externally):

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
```
