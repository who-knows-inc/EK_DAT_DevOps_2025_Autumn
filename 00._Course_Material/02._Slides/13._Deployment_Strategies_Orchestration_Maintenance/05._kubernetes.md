# K8s

Originally developed by Google but is now open-source. 

Google runs several billions of containers weekly in Google Cloud:

# Features of Kubernetes

**Auto-scaling**.

**Monitoring**: It monitors the health of the containers and the nodes. Kubernetes dashboard comes out of the box.

**Automatic Deployment** across different servers, even different regions.

# Kubernetes Architecture

* **Container**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

* **Pod**: A group of one or more containers.

A pod shares the same volume, namespace, and network (IP address).

* **Service**: A way to expose an application running in a set of pods as a network service.

* **Node**: A physical or virtual machine.

* **Cluster**: A group of nodes. The Master Node manages the Worker Nodes.


---

# Supported container runtimes

* Docker

* Containerd

* CRI-O

---

# Kubernetes in the cloud

* Linode Kubernetes

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

[EKS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/EKS)

**Guessing game**: *How much would the default values of 1 cluster (Standard Support) and 2 clusters (Extended Support) cost per month?*

# [Optional] AKS hands-on

AKS is included in Azure `Free Services`. That means that the cluster management is free, but you will still be charged for VM, storage and networking usage etc.

Recommended video on how to get started with AKS.

The timestamped part contains a very elegant explanation of the propogation from `Kubectl` -> `Control Plane` -> `Node`.

# Kubernetes is not a silver bullet for scaling

Many think that Kubernetes will magically solve all scalability issues. These issues remain:

* Properly managing container resource allocation

* Anticipating peak demand and scaling accordingly

* Handling inefficient scaling of stateful applications

* Addressing underlying infrastructure bottlenecks

That's why configure management is the essence of a large-scale Kubernetes deployment.

It would not be unusual to have 1 or 2 full-time employees dedicated to managing a large Kubernetes cluster.

# Do you need Kubernetes?

Probably not! Just because Google does it, doesn't mean you should. 

Challenges of Kubernetes:

* Extremely high cost 

* Steep learning curve, time sink

* Configuration complexity, risk of misconfiguration

* Security challenges  

* Computational overhead  

* Local replication difficulty

# Downsides to Kubernetes

| Challenge                                | Details                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meeting isolation standards              | Isolation of applications on the same server is vital for security.                                                               |
| Internal networking challenges           | The latency between services needs to be accounted for in large clusters.                                                         |
| Limited visibility into resource utilization | In large clusters with many applications and services running, it is difficult to know what level of resources systems are consuming. |
| Optimizing resource usage                | As the cluster grows in size, cost management and resource optimization become more critical and more complex.                     |
| Deployment failovers and downtime mitigation | Large-scale application rollouts must have fail-safes to avoid downtime risk.                                                     |
| Reduced visibility into data flows       | As a cluster grows in size and across regions, maintaining visibility into data flows becomes increasingly complex.                |
| Patch management                         | Applying K8s security patches and updates at scale without interrupting service or impacting performance is an operational challenge.|
| Access management and tenant isolation   | For large clusters, isolation between different teams or customers using the cluster must be configured.                           |
| On-prem challenges                       | Running clusters on your own data center infrastructure adds additional management complexities, including avoiding network partitions and upgrading servers. |

# Avoid the cargo cult mentality that pervades our industry

Many companies jump on the idea of implementing high-availability, fault-tolerant and highly scalable systems.

In Denmark most companies do not need this but there is a tendency to look at what the big companies are doing. 

You are in no way expected to implement today's topics for your project. The goal is to inform you about the possibilities and how to solve certain challenges, may they present themselves to you.

**Counter point**: The blog post - [You have built a Kubernetes](https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2024/you-have-built-a-kubernetes/) - details how in an attempt to avoid using Kubernetes and through custom parameterized shell scripts and Docker Compose, a worse version of Kubernetes was built.
