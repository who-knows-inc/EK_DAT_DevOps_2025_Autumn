# Exam Presentation Requirements

## The Format

This is taken directly from the source of truth, [Kea Katalog](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/3050407/2025-2026):

> Eksamen starter som et gruppeoplæg/-præsentation, der varer i 5 minutter per studerende. Herefter individuel eksamination i 20 minutter inkl. votering.

Remember that the allotted time always includes getting into the room, setting up and getting out. I recommend that you try to connect your computer to the projector in the exact room ahead of the exam. Maybe have a backup and have the demo ready on more than one computer.

Only have one laptop open. No timers. No notes.

# Advice for the group presentation

Avoid slides. If you want to show diagrams, you could have them open in a tab.

Avoid reading. Each student only has to memorize less than 5 minutes.

Starting with an agenda brings little value. Just jump straight into the presentation.

Focus on demoing every part of the system rather than presenting through slides. This is the first time censor and I see the final product and your job is to sell us on the technical aspects of the entire system.

Both censor and I know what `whoknows` is. You can briefly flash the website without demoing it since it’s probably the least interesting part of your system. 

You can safely assume that we have read the report. This is another case for demoing, which is something the report can't do.

If you choose to show SonarQube Cloud it is more interesting to show how you've set it up to interact with a PR or push. Pointing out how few warnings you have in the dashboard is not a flex considering how easy they are to dismiss.

# Advice for the individual examination

Study based on the learning goals in the semester plan. 

Have the following ready:

- The exam report
- Relevant tabs open for the website, monitoring, CI/CD pipeline, documentation, etc.
- The mandatories

The individual examination is incredibly short (20 minutes including voting).

Expect a lot of rapid-fire questions and try to provide short answers.

I have a mental checklist of things I want to get answers to.

Being stopped is not necessarily a bad sign. It could either mean that I want to steer you towards a specific answer or that you've already answered what I was looking for.

Stopping you could also mean that you have answered what I wanted and I am ready to move on.

Another piece af advice is to look at the slides because we build up our own unique definitions and terminology throughout the semester. Examples include `DevOps princples` and our definition of `CD/CD` according to the slides.
